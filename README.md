### User stories

1. My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding ```id="header"```.
2. I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding ```id="header-img"```. A company logo would make a good image here.
3. Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding ```id="nav-bar"```.
4. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class ```nav-link```.
5. When I click a ```.nav-link``` button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
6. I can watch an embedded product video with ```id="video"```.
7. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding ```id="form"```.
8. Within the form, there is an input field with ```id="email"``` where I can enter an email address.
9. The ```#email``` input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The ```#email``` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding ```id="submit"```.
12. When I click the ```#submit``` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
